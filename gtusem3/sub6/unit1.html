					<h2 class="major">1.1 Introduction to Medical and Wellness Tourism</h2>
					<h3>Medical Tourism</h3>
					<p>Medical tourism refers to the process of traveling across borders to receive medical treatment, which may range from essential surgeries to elective procedures. Often, it is sought due to affordability, availability, or higher quality of care in the destination country.</p>
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> Many people from Africa, Bangladesh, and Middle Eastern countries travel to India for cardiac bypass surgeries, organ transplants, or fertility treatments because of the lower cost and high-quality healthcare services available here.</p>

					<h3>Wellness Tourism</h3>
					<p>Wellness tourism focuses on preventive, lifestyle-enhancing, and holistic services that help maintain or improve one’s well-being. It includes spa treatments, yoga retreats, detox therapies, and more.</p>
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> International tourists visiting Kerala for Ayurvedic wellness retreats, yoga camps in Rishikesh, or spa treatments in Bali and Thailand.</p>

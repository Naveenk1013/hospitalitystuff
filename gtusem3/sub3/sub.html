					<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p>Globally, providing a room with meals inclusive is a standard practice in the hospitality industry. Hotels, especially the upscale ones, often include meals in the room rate. A plan without meals is considered the cheapest, while those including full-course meals are priced higher.</p>
					<p>Generally, there are four types of meal plans followed worldwide: <strong>American Plan (AP), Modified American Plan (MAP), Continental Plan (CP), and European Plan (EP).</strong></p>

					<h3>What is a Meal Plan?</h3>
					<p>A meal plan is a package added to a room rate that includes meals for hotel guests. Choosing the right meal plan is essential for travelers to understand the inclusions and compare rates effectively.</p>
					<p>Based on the type of meal plan, hotels are classified as follows:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>European Plan (EP)</li>
						<li>Continental Plan (CP)</li>
						<li>American Plan (AP)</li>
						<li>Modified American Plan (MAP)</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>1. European Plan (EP)</h3>
					<p>This plan includes only lodging, meaning the guest pays for accommodation only. Meals, beverages, and other services are charged separately. Guests are free to dine outside the hotel. This plan is commonly used by hotels in metropolitan cities and youth hostels.</p>
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> In India, most public sector hotels operate on the European Plan basis.</p>

					<h3>2. Continental Plan (CP)</h3>
					<p>Under this plan, the room rate includes lodging and breakfast. Guests are free to take other meals as per their choice, for which they are billed separately.</p>
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> A guest pays for bed and breakfast, and orders lunch or dinner as desired.</p>

					<h3>3. American Plan (AP)</h3>
					<p>Also known as the <em>Full Board</em> or <em>Full Pension</em> plan, the American Plan includes accommodation and three meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). It is popular in resorts or tourist destinations where guests prefer to dine within the hotel.</p>
					<p>The menu is usually <em>table d’hôte</em> (a fixed meal with limited choices at a collective price).</p>
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> Hill resorts or beachside hotels offering all-inclusive packages.</p>

					<h3>4. Modified American Plan (MAP)</h3>
					<p>This plan includes lodging, breakfast, and one major meal—either lunch or dinner. It offers flexibility to guests and is known as <em>demi-pension</em>.</p>
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> A business traveler may prefer breakfast and dinner included while managing lunch outside during meetings.</p>

					<h3>Topic: Tariff Fixation (Cost-Based & Market-Based)</h3>

					<h3>Introduction to Tariff Fixation</h3>
					<p>In the hospitality industry, <strong>tariff</strong> refers to the price charged by a hotel for its rooms and services. Tariff fixation is a strategic process that considers both internal costs and external market dynamics to determine room pricing.</p>

					<h3>Importance of Tariff Fixation</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Ensures profitability and sustainability</li>
						<li>Helps in competitive positioning</li>
						<li>Attracts the right market segment</li>
						<li>Assists in revenue forecasting and budgeting</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>I. Cost-Based Tariff Fixation</h3>
					<p>Cost-based pricing involves setting room rates based on total operational costs plus a profit margin.</p>
					<p><strong>Formula:</strong> Tariff = Cost per room + Desired profit margin</p>

					<table>
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th>Type of Cost</th>
								<th>Example</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr><td>Fixed Costs</td><td>Salaries, Rent, Property Tax, Insurance</td></tr>
							<tr><td>Variable Costs</td><td>Utilities, Housekeeping supplies, Guest amenities</td></tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>

					<h4>Example – Budget Hotel Calculation</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Fixed cost: ₹9,00,000</li>
						<li>Variable cost per occupied room: ₹300</li>
						<li>Occupancy: 60%</li>
						<li>Rooms sold: 540 per month</li>
						<li>Total variable cost: ₹1,62,000</li>
						<li>Total cost: ₹10,62,000</li>
						<li>Cost per room: ₹1,966</li>
						<li>Profit (20%): ₹393</li>
						<li><strong>Final Tariff:</strong> ₹2,360</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Advantages of Cost-Based Tariff</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Covers operational expenses</li>
						<li>Ensures profitability</li>
						<li>Easy to calculate</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Limitations</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Ignores market competition</li>
						<li>May not attract price-sensitive guests</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>II. Market-Based Tariff Fixation</h3>
					<p>This method considers demand, competition, and customer perception to determine pricing. It is flexible and responsive to market conditions.</p>

					<h4>1. Competitor-Based Pricing</h4>
					<p>Hotels set tariffs similar to or slightly lower than nearby competitors to attract guests.</p>

					<h4>2. Demand-Based (Dynamic) Pricing</h4>
					<p>Rates change based on demand, season, or events. Example: A resort in Goa charging ₹8,000 during peak season and ₹3,500 in off-season.</p>

					<h4>3. Psychological Pricing</h4>
					<p>Prices are set to influence perception, e.g., ₹4,999 instead of ₹5,000.</p>

					<h4>4. Skimming Pricing</h4>
					<p>High rates for new luxury hotels to attract premium customers.</p>

					<h4>5. Penetration Pricing</h4>
					<p>Low introductory rates to enter a competitive market.</p>

					<h4>Example – Market-Based Fixation (Star Hotel)</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Marriott Mumbai weekday rate: ₹10,000</li>
						<li>Weekend rate: ₹7,000</li>
						<li>Event season rate: ₹14,000</li>
						<li>Loyalty discount: 15%</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Advantages</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Aligns with market demand</li>
						<li>Attracts guests during low occupancy</li>
						<li>Encourages competitiveness</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Limitations</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Frequent rate changes may confuse guests</li>
						<li>Low pricing can impact brand image</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>III. Hybrid Pricing Strategy</h3>
					<p>Most hotels use a mix of cost-based and market-based approaches. First, they calculate the minimum cost to avoid losses, then adjust prices according to demand and competitors.</p>
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> If the cost per room is ₹2,000 and the market rate is ₹3,000–₹3,500, the hotel may fix ₹3,200 to ensure profitability and competitiveness.</p>

              <p>Horticulture blends science and art to cultivate plants—flowers, fruits, and vegetables—and to shape outdoor and interior green spaces. Flower arrangement is the creative aspect of horticulture: composing flowers, foliage and containers into harmony of colour, form, texture and scale so they enhance environments and convey meaning.</p>

            <div>
              <p>The art follows core design principles: balance, proportion, rhythm, variety, emphasis, harmony, repetition and distinction. Good design also considers background, container, scale and the relationship between components.</p>

              <h3>Key Principles (short list)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Scaling / Proportion</li>
                <li>Balance: physical and visual</li>
                <li>Rhythm (flow and motion)</li>
                <li>Variety & Texture</li>
                <li>Proper use of colour</li>
                <li>Emphasis (focal point)</li>
                <li>Harmony and distinction</li>
                <li>Repetition (in moderation)</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Design Guidelines</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Stems should flow from a central point; avoid crossed stems</li>
                <li>Focal point should draw the eye and may be the tallest element</li>
                <li>Avoid monotonous flower choice; vary scale and opening stages</li>
                <li>Shape must suit the container and site</li>
                <li>No flower should be more than one-third the size of the container (general rule)</li>
                <li>Height of material: about 1 to 1.5 times container height (or width for long low containers)</li>

              <p>The site of an arrangement affects scale, fragrance choices and visibility.</p>

              <h3>Common Locations and Guidelines</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Table arrangements:</strong> Low, unobtrusive, viewable from all sides; must not block conversation.</li>
                <li><strong>Reception desk:</strong> Bold, front-facing and dominant to suit large counters.</li>
                <li><strong>Guest rooms:</strong> Small, non-perfumed arrangements; size proportionate to room and surface.</li>
              </ul>

              <p class="small-note">Rule of thumb: Tall vases - tallest elements 1.5 to 2 times vase length. Lower arrangements require smaller stems to conform visually.</p>

                <li>Cut stems at a slant with sharp tools (early morning or after sunset)</li>
                <li>Carry cut flowers heads-down to avoid snapping</li>
                <li>Re-cut stems under water to remove air bubbles and callus</li>
                <li>Remove foliage below waterline to reduce bacterial growth</li>
                <li>Use commercial preservatives or simple mixes (sugar + tiny bleach) to slow bacterial growth</li>
              </ul>

            <div>
              <h3>How to Cut & Re-cut</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Always cut at a slant; re-cut stems that have been out of water</li>
                <li>For woody stems: scrape or split ends to expose inner tissue</li>
                <li>Hollow stems: plug with cotton and use as wick if needed</li>
                <li>Milky/latex stems: briefly sear cut ends to stop sap leak</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Water Temperature</h3>
              <p>Warm water aids uptake; brief boiling or searing may sterilize the end and expel air bubbles, improving water uptake for certain stems.</p>

              <h3>Grooming & Maintenance</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Wash foliage, trim damaged leaves and dead flowers</li>
                <li>Regularly change water, clean containers and add preservative</li>
                <li>Misting morning and evening preserves freshness</li>
                <li>Avoid placing arrangements near ripening fruit (ethylene gas) or direct heat sources</li>
              </ul>

      <h3>Option A: Uniform and Sewing Room Management</h3>

      <h3>1. Layout of the Uniform Room</h3>
      <p>
        An effective uniform room layout should allow smooth flow from receipt → storage → issuing → return/exchange 
        while keeping clean and soiled uniforms separate.
      </p>

      <h4>1.1 Key Sections in the Layout:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Reception/Counter Area: For staff to collect and return uniforms</li>
        <li>Storage Area (Clean): Racks, shelves, or lockers organized by department and size</li>
        <li>Storage Area (Soiled): Separate section for dirty uniforms awaiting laundry</li>
        <li>Sorting & Inspection Area: For checking quality, damages, and repair needs</li>
        <li>Repair & Alteration Section: Small sewing corner for minor fixes (buttons, seams)</li>
        <li>Fitting Area: Mirrors and space for trying uniforms during allocation</li>
        <li>Record-Keeping Desk: For maintaining registers and digital records</li>
        <li>Laundry Pickup/Drop-off Zone: Access point for laundry staff</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>1.2 Design Considerations:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Adequate ventilation to avoid musty odors</li>
        <li>Bright lighting for inspection</li>
        <li>Clearly labeled storage sections</li>
        <li>Separate entry/exit for laundry flow in large properties</li>
      </ul>

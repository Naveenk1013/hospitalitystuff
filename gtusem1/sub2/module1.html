					<h3>1.2 Importance of Rooms Division in Hotel Operations</h3>

							</ul>
						</li>

							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Brand Image and Loyalty:</strong>
							<ul>

								<li>Consistent service quality in the rooms division can differentiate a hotel from its competitors, fostering a unique selling proposition (USP).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Health and Safety Compliance:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Housekeeping ensures rooms are sanitized and safe, particularly important in the post-pandemic era, to protect both guests and staff.</li>
								<li>Front office staff are trained in safety protocols, including emergency procedures and guest health screenings.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

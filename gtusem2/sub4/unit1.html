					<h3>Module 1: Basic Concepts & Development of Tourism</h3>

					<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

					<h4>History and Evolution of Tourism</h4>
					<p>Tourism, as a concept, has existed since ancient times. Early forms of tourism can be traced back to the Greeks and Romans, who traveled for leisure, trade, and exploration. In the medieval period, religious pilgrimages became a primary travel motivation. The Industrial Revolution (18th-19th century) marked a significant shift, as economic prosperity, technological advancements (such as steam engines), and improved transportation systems enabled the middle class to travel. The 20th century witnessed the rise of mass tourism, facilitated by automobiles, airplanes, and economic growth. Today, digital advancements and globalization have further shaped the tourism industry, making travel more accessible worldwide.</p>

					<h4>Nature & Meaning of Tourism</h4>
					<p>Tourism refers to the activities of people traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for leisure, business, or other purposes, typically for less than one year. It involves multiple sectors, including transportation, hospitality, attractions, and entertainment, making it a significant economic and social phenomenon.</p>

					<h4>Definition of Tourism</h4>
					<p>Several organizations and scholars have defined tourism:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>UNWTO (United Nations World Tourism Organization):</strong> "Tourism comprises the activities of persons traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business, or other purposes."</li>
						<li><strong>Hunziker and Krapf (1941):</strong> "Tourism is the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non-residents, in so far as they do not lead to permanent residence and are not connected with any earning activity."</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>The 6 ‘A’s of Tourism</h4>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Attractions</strong> – Natural, cultural, historical, and artificial attractions that draw visitors.</li>
						<li><strong>Accessibility</strong> – Transportation systems that facilitate travel.</li>
						<li><strong>Accommodation</strong> – Hotels, resorts, homestays, and other lodging facilities.</li>
						<li><strong>Amenities</strong> – Essential services like restaurants, shops, banks, and health facilities.</li>
						<li><strong>Activities</strong> – Leisure, adventure, wellness, business, and cultural activities available to tourists.</li>
						<li><strong>Ancillary Services</strong> – Supporting services like tour operators, travel agencies, and information centers.</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>2. a. Classification of Visitors</h3>
					<p>Visitors can be classified into:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Tourists</strong> – Stay at least 24 hours, engage in leisure, business, or other activities.</li>
						<li><strong>Excursionists</strong> – Stay for less than 24 hours without overnight accommodation.</li>
						<li><strong>Domestic Visitors</strong> – Travel within their own country.</li>
						<li><strong>International Visitors</strong> – Travel to a country other than their residence.</li>
						<li><strong>Leisure Tourists</strong> – Travel for relaxation, entertainment, and holiday purposes.</li>
						<li><strong>Business Tourists</strong> – Travel for work-related purposes such as meetings, conferences, or training.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>b. Travel Motivations & Typology of Tourists</h3>
					<p>Travel motivations vary and can be categorized using Maslow’s hierarchy of needs:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Physiological Needs</strong> – Travel for relaxation and rest.</li>
						<li><strong>Safety Needs</strong> – Seeking secure and comfortable travel experiences.</li>
						<li><strong>Social Needs</strong> – Traveling for social interaction, family, and friends.</li>
						<li><strong>Esteem Needs</strong> – Seeking recognition and prestige, such as luxury travel.</li>
						<li><strong>Self-Actualization</strong> – Travel for personal growth, adventure, or learning.</li>
					</ol>
					<p><strong>Typology of Tourists (Cohen’s Classification):</strong></p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Organized Mass Tourist</strong> – Prefers guided tours and package travel.</li>
						<li><strong>Individual Mass Tourist</strong> – Travels independently but still follows a structured itinerary.</li>
						<li><strong>Explorer</strong> – Seeks new experiences but maintains some comfort.</li>
						<li><strong>Drifter</strong> – Engages in unplanned, adventurous travel.</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>3. Characteristics of Tourism</h3>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Intangibility</strong> – Tourism is an experience-based industry rather than a tangible product.</li>
						<li><strong>Perishability</strong> – Services cannot be stored for future use (e.g., an unoccupied hotel room is lost revenue).</li>
						<li><strong>Heterogeneity</strong> – Services vary depending on provider, location, and time.</li>
						<li><strong>Seasonality</strong> – Demand fluctuates based on weather, holidays, and events.</li>
						<li><strong>Interdependency</strong> – Various sectors such as transportation, accommodation, and attractions must work together.</li>
						<li><strong>Inseparability</strong> – The production and consumption of tourism services occur simultaneously.</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>4. Tourism Infrastructure</h3>
					<p>Tourism infrastructure includes essential physical and organizational structures necessary for tourism development.</p>
					<p><strong>Key Components:</strong></p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Transport Infrastructure</strong> – Airports, railways, highways, ports, and public transportation.</li>
						<li><strong>Accommodation Facilities</strong> – Hotels, resorts, motels, hostels, and homestays.</li>

					</ol>

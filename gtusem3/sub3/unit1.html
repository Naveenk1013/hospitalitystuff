					<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p>Globally, providing a room with meals inclusive is a standard practice in the hospitality industry. Hotels, especially the upscale ones, often include meals in the room rate. A plan without meals is considered the cheapest, while those including full-course meals are priced higher.</p>
					<p>Generally, there are four types of meal plans followed worldwide: <strong>American Plan (AP), Modified American Plan (MAP), Continental Plan (CP), and European Plan (EP).</strong></p>

					<h3>What is a Meal Plan?</h3>
					<p>A meal plan is a package added to a room rate that includes meals for hotel guests. Choosing the right meal plan is essential for travelers to understand the inclusions and compare rates effectively.</p>
					<p>Based on the type of meal plan, hotels are classified as follows:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>European Plan (EP)</li>
						<li>Continental Plan (CP)</li>
						<li>American Plan (AP)</li>
						<li>Modified American Plan (MAP)</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>1. European Plan (EP)</h3>
					<p>This plan includes only lodging, meaning the guest pays for accommodation only. Meals, beverages, and other services are charged separately. Guests are free to dine outside the hotel. This plan is commonly used by hotels in metropolitan cities and youth hostels.</p>
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> In India, most public sector hotels operate on the European Plan basis.</p>

					<h3>2. Continental Plan (CP)</h3>
					<p>Under this plan, the room rate includes lodging and breakfast. Guests are free to take other meals as per their choice, for which they are billed separately.</p>
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> A guest pays for bed and breakfast, and orders lunch or dinner as desired.</p>

					<h3>3. American Plan (AP)</h3>
					<p>Also known as the <em>Full Board</em> or <em>Full Pension</em> plan, the American Plan includes accommodation and three meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). It is popular in resorts or tourist destinations where guests prefer to dine within the hotel.</p>
					<p>The menu is usually <em>table d’hôte</em> (a fixed meal with limited choices at a collective price).</p>
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> Hill resorts or beachside hotels offering all-inclusive packages.</p>

					<h3>4. Modified American Plan (MAP)</h3>
					<p>This plan includes lodging, breakfast, and one major meal—either lunch or dinner. It offers flexibility to guests and is known as <em>demi-pension</em>.</p>
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> A business traveler may prefer breakfast and dinner included while managing lunch outside during meetings.</p>

					<h3>Topic: Tariff Fixation (Cost-Based & Market-Based)</h3>

					<h3>Introduction to Tariff Fixation</h3>
					<p>In the hospitality industry, <strong>tariff</strong> refers to the price charged by a hotel for its rooms and services. Tariff fixation is a strategic process that considers both internal costs and external market dynamics to determine room pricing.</p>

					<h3>Importance of Tariff Fixation</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Ensures profitability and sustainability</li>
						<li>Helps in competitive positioning</li>
						<li>Attracts the right market segment</li>
						<li>Assists in revenue forecasting and budgeting</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>I. Cost-Based Tariff Fixation</h3>
					<p>Cost-based pricing involves setting room rates based on total operational costs plus a profit margin.</p>
					<p><strong>Formula:</strong> Tariff = Cost per room + Desired profit margin</p>

					<table>
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th>Type of Cost</th>
								<th>Example</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr><td>Fixed Costs</td><td>Salaries, Rent, Property Tax, Insurance</td></tr>
							<tr><td>Variable Costs</td><td>Utilities, Housekeeping supplies, Guest amenities</td></tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>

					<h4>Example – Budget Hotel Calculation</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Fixed cost: ₹9,00,000</li>
						<li>Variable cost per occupied room: ₹300</li>
						<li>Occupancy: 60%</li>
						<li>Rooms sold: 540 per month</li>
						<li>Total variable cost: ₹1,62,000</li>
						<li>Total cost: ₹10,62,000</li>
						<li>Cost per room: ₹1,966</li>
						<li>Profit (20%): ₹393</li>
						<li><strong>Final Tariff:</strong> ₹2,360</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Advantages of Cost-Based Tariff</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Covers operational expenses</li>
						<li>Ensures profitability</li>
						<li>Easy to calculate</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Limitations</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Ignores market competition</li>
						<li>May not attract price-sensitive guests</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>II. Market-Based Tariff Fixation</h3>
					<p>This method considers demand, competition, and customer perception to determine pricing. It is flexible and responsive to market conditions.</p>

					<h4>1. Competitor-Based Pricing</h4>
					<p>Hotels set tariffs similar to or slightly lower than nearby competitors to attract guests.</p>

					<h4>2. Demand-Based (Dynamic) Pricing</h4>
					<p>Rates change based on demand, season, or events. Example: A resort in Goa charging ₹8,000 during peak season and ₹3,500 in off-season.</p>

					<h4>3. Psychological Pricing</h4>
					<p>Prices are set to influence perception, e.g., ₹4,999 instead of ₹5,000.</p>

					<h4>4. Skimming Pricing</h4>
					<p>High rates for new luxury hotels to attract premium customers.</p>

					<h4>5. Penetration Pricing</h4>
					<p>Low introductory rates to enter a competitive market.</p>

					<h4>Example – Market-Based Fixation (Star Hotel)</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Marriott Mumbai weekday rate: ₹10,000</li>
						<li>Weekend rate: ₹7,000</li>
						<li>Event season rate: ₹14,000</li>
						<li>Loyalty discount: 15%</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Advantages</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Aligns with market demand</li>
						<li>Attracts guests during low occupancy</li>
						<li>Encourages competitiveness</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Limitations</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Frequent rate changes may confuse guests</li>
						<li>Low pricing can impact brand image</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>III. Hybrid Pricing Strategy</h3>
					<p>Most hotels use a mix of cost-based and market-based approaches. First, they calculate the minimum cost to avoid losses, then adjust prices according to demand and competitors.</p>
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> If the cost per room is ₹2,000 and the market rate is ₹3,000–₹3,500, the hotel may fix ₹3,200 to ensure profitability and competitiveness.</p>

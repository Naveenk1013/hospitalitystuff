Below is a detailed guide on how to establish a travel agency in India.</p>

					<h4>Step 1: Business Registration</h4>
					<p>The first step in setting up a travel agency is deciding on the business structure and registering it under the appropriate legal framework.</p>

					<h5>1. Choose a Business Structure</h5>
					<p>Depending on ownership and scale, travel agencies can be registered as:</p>

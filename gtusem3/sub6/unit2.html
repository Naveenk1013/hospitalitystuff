					<h3>2.1 Concept, Typology, Genesis, and Growth of Medical Tourism</h3>

					<h3>Concept of Health & Medical Tourism</h3>
					<p>Health Tourism is a broad term that includes all forms of travel where the primary purpose is to improve or maintain one’s health and well-being.</p>
					<p><strong>Medical Tourism</strong>, a subset of health tourism, refers to the practice of traveling to another country to obtain medical treatment. This may include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Essential treatments: cardiac surgery, orthopaedic procedures, organ transplants</li>
						<li>Elective procedures: dental work, cosmetic surgery</li>
						<li>Reproductive care: IVF, surrogacy, fertility treatments</li>
					</ul>
					<p>It combines medical expertise, affordable treatment, and travel/tourism appeal into a growing international industry.</p>

						<li><strong>Medieval Period:</strong> Pilgrimages to sacred sites like Lourdes (France) for miraculous healing.</li>
						<li><strong>Modern Era:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>1980s–1990s: Globalization of healthcare began.</li>
								<li>2000s onwards: Surge in cross-border medical travel due to rising healthcare costs in Western countries and improved infrastructure in developing nations like India, Thailand, and Malaysia.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Unit 2: Typology of Tourism</h3>

					<h3>1. Forms of Tourism</h3>

					<h4>a. International Tourism</h4>
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> Imagine Rahul from Mumbai planning a trip to Paris, France. He will need a passport and possibly a visa, and he will experience a different culture and language.</p>

					<h4>b. Inbound Tourism</h4>
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> A group of tourists from Japan visiting the Taj Mahal in Agra, India. The Indian tourism industry benefits from their visit through foreign exchange and cultural exchange.</p>

					<h4>c. Outbound Tourism</h4>
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> Rahul decides to travel to Thailand for a vacation. He will contribute to Thailand's tourism industry and experience Thai culture and cuisine.</p>

					<h4>d. Inter-regional Tourism</h4>
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> Rahul travels from Mumbai in Western India to Kolkata in Eastern India. He will experience different regional cultures, cuisines, and landscapes within India.</p>

					<h4>e. Intra-regional Tourism</h4>
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> Rahul takes a weekend trip from Mumbai to the nearby hill station of Lonavala. This short trip allows him to explore attractions within the same region.</p>

					<h4>f. Regional Tourism</h4>
					<p>The state of Rajasthan promotes its unique cultural heritage and attractions, such as Jaipur's palaces and Jaisalmer's desert safaris, to attract tourists from other parts of India and abroad.</p>

					<h4>g. Domestic Tourism</h4>
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> Rahul plans a trip to the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Punjab. He travels within India, supporting local businesses and experiencing diverse domestic cultures.</p>

					<h4>h. Internal Tourism</h4>
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> Rahul visits the historical sites of Hampi in Karnataka. This form of tourism focuses on exploring attractions within one's own country.</p>

					<h4>i. National Tourism</h4>

					<h4>Three Main Elements of Leiper’s Tourism System:</h4>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>The Traveler (Tourist):</strong> The person who travels for leisure, business, or other purposes.</li>
						<li><strong>Three Key Geographical Regions:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Tourist Generating Region (TGR): The place where tourists start their journey (e.g., their hometown).</li>
								<li>Transit Route Region (TRR): The places tourists pass through while traveling (e.g., airports, highways, or stopover cities).</li>
								<li>Tourist Destination Region (TDR): The place where tourists go for their vacation or trip.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Tourism Industry (Businesses & Services):</strong> Hotels, airlines, travel agencies, restaurants, and attractions that support tourism.</li>
					</ol>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>TGR (Tourist Generating Region):</strong> Mumbai – where Rahul lives and plans his trip.</li>

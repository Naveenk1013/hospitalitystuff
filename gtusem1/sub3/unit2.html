<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Food commodities are the basic raw materials or ingredients used in food production and service. They include all food items that are purchased, stored, processed, cooked, and served in hotels, restaurants, and catering establishments. Understanding food commodities helps chefs and service professionals to ensure quality, nutrition, cost control, and menu planning.</p>

<h3>2. Definition</h3>
<p>A food commodity is any substance or product, whether raw, semi-processed, or processed, that is intended for human consumption. <strong>Example:</strong> Cereals, pulses, meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, dairy products, sugar, and spices.</p>

<h3>4. Importance of Food Commodities in the Hospitality Industry</h3>
<ol>
<li>Menu Planning: Helps in designing balanced and cost-effective menus.</li>
<li>Cost Control: Knowledge of commodity prices and quality ensures profitable operations.</li>
<li>Nutrition: Enables chefs to choose ingredients that provide balanced nutrition.</li>
<li>Quality Assurance: Ensures the use of fresh, high-standard ingredients.</li>
<li>Inventory Management: Helps maintain the right quantity and freshness of items.</li>
<li>Guest Satisfaction: High-quality food commodities enhance taste and presentation.</li>
</ol>

<h3>5. Factors Affecting Selection of Food Commodities</h3>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> The selection of food commodities is a crucial part of food production and service in hotels and restaurants. Choosing the right ingredients ensures good quality, nutrition, taste, cost-effectiveness, and customer satisfaction. Several factors influence the selection of food commodities in the hospitality industry.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Quality and Freshness:</strong> The most important factor. Only fresh, good-quality ingredients should be selected to ensure safe and tasty food. <em>Example:</em> Fresh fruits, crisp vegetables, and tender meat give better results than stale items.</li>
<li><strong>Availability and Seasonality:</strong> Some commodities are seasonal, such as mangoes or strawberries. Selection depends on what is available in the market during that time. Seasonal products are usually cheaper and better in quality.</li>
<li><strong>Cost and Budget:</strong> The price of commodities affects menu planning and food cost control. The goal is to select good-quality items within the budget to maintain profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Storage Facilities:</strong> Selection also depends on available storage space and equipment (cold rooms, refrigerators, dry stores). Perishable items should only be bought in small quantities if storage is limited.</li>
<li><strong>Supplier Reliability:</strong> Reliable suppliers provide consistent quality, timely delivery, and fair prices. Selection is easier when suppliers are trustworthy and meet the hotel’s standards.</li>
<li><strong>Menu Requirements:</strong> The choice of ingredients depends on the type of menu and dishes being prepared. <em>Example:</em> A continental menu requires different commodities compared to an Indian menu.</li>
<li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Nutrient-rich food commodities are preferred to ensure a balanced and healthy diet. Especially important in hospitals, schools, and health-conscious restaurants.</li>
<li><strong>Shelf Life:</strong> Commodities with a longer shelf life (like rice, flour, or canned goods) are preferred for bulk buying. Perishable items (like milk or seafood) should be purchased daily.</li>
<li><strong>Legal and Hygiene Standards:</strong> Food commodities must meet FSSAI or local food safety regulations. Suppliers should follow proper hygiene and packaging standards.</li>
<li><strong>Customer Preferences:</strong> Selection should reflect the taste, dietary needs, and cultural preferences of customers. <em>Example:</em> Vegetarian guests, Jain cuisine, or gluten-free menu items.</li>

<h3>Role of Fats and Oils Used in Cookery</h3>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4>
<p>Fats and oils are essential ingredients in cookery that add flavor, texture, richness, and nutrition to food. They are used in various cooking methods such as frying, baking, roasting, and sautéing. Both play a key role in energy supply, taste enhancement, and food preparation in the hospitality industry.</p>

<h4>2. Definition</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fats</strong> are solid at room temperature (e.g., butter, ghee, margarine).</li>
<li><strong>Oils</strong> are liquid at room temperature (e.g., sunflower oil, olive oil, mustard oil).</li>
</ul>
<p>Both are composed mainly of fatty acids and glycerol, and serve as major sources of energy in the human diet.</p>

<h4>3. Sources of Fats and Oils</h4>

<th>Source</th>
<th>Examples</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Animal-based Fats</td>
<td>Butter, Ghee, Fish Oil</td>

<td>Olive Oil, Mustard Oil, Sunflower Oil, Coconut Oil</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Processed Fats</td>
<td>Margarine, Shortening, Hydrogenated Fats</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h4>4. Role of Fats and Oils in Cookery</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Medium of Cooking:</strong> Used for frying, roasting, and sautéing. Help transfer heat evenly and cook food quickly. <em>Example:</em> Deep-fried snacks, sautéed vegetables.</li>
<li><strong>Enhances Flavor and Aroma:</strong> Adds richness and distinct taste to food. Some oils (like sesame or mustard) impart characteristic flavors to cuisines.</li>
<li><strong>Improves Texture and Mouthfeel:</strong> Makes food soft, moist, and smooth. Provides flakiness in pastries and crispness in fried items.</li>
<li><strong>Acts as a Tenderizer:</strong> Fats coat the flour particles and reduce gluten formation in dough. Makes cakes, pastries, and breads soft and tender.</li>
<li><strong>Used as a Spreading Agent:</strong> Butter, margarine, and ghee are used as spreads on bread, toast, and bakery items.</li>
<li><strong>Provides Moisture and Shine:</strong> Adds gloss and moisture to baked or roasted dishes. Helps retain freshness and prevents drying.</li>
<li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Fats and oils are concentrated sources of energy (9 kcal per gram). They also provide fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.</li>
<li><strong>Preservation:</strong> Used in pickles, chutneys, and canned foods to prevent spoilage by forming a protective layer.</li>
<li><strong>Conducts Flavor Compounds:</strong> Many herbs and spices dissolve in fat, enhancing their flavor release during cooking.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Health Considerations: Type of Fat Consumed</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Saturated Fats (Use in Moderation):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Found in butter, ghee, cream, lard, and red meat.</li>
<li>Can raise cholesterol levels and increase risk of heart disease if consumed in excess.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Unsaturated Fats (Healthy Fats):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Found in vegetable oils (sunflower, olive, mustard, soybean).</li>
<li>Help lower bad cholesterol (LDL) and improve heart health.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Trans Fats (Avoid):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Found in margarine, bakery products, and deep-fried fast foods.</li>
<li>Increase risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Spices and Herbs Used in Cooking</h3>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4>
<p>Spices and herbs are essential ingredients used in cooking to enhance the flavor, aroma, and appearance of food. They are used in small quantities, but they play a major role in improving the taste, digestion, and nutritional value of dishes.</p>

<h4>2. Definition</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spices:</strong> Dried parts of plants such as seeds, bark, roots, fruits, or flower buds used for flavoring food. <em>Example:</em> Clove, Cinnamon, Pepper, Cumin.</li>
<li><strong>Herbs:</strong> The green leafy parts of plants used fresh or dried to flavor and garnish dishes. <em>Example:</em> Coriander leaves, Mint, Basil, Thyme.</li>
</ul>
